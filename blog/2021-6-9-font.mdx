import styles from "./2021-6-9-font.module.css";

This font is developed by an Indonesian ([Fatma Wati](https://www.behance.net/fatmastudio)), and I just absolutely loved it. (FYI my personal server's hostname is _Caroline_ as well. Caroline is truely a special name.)

<!-- truncate -->

Try it out in the box below:

<div contentEditable className={styles.out}>
  Hello world!
</div>

I found the font here: https://www.dafont.com/caroline-2.font

I hope one day I can develop a handwriting font that's anywhere close to this... Wish myself good luck on this:)
