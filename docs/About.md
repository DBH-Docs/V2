When I was building this website, I was in a dilemma. Mostly, about the positioning—what should I post? What's the target audience? What should I establish myself as? How seriously should I take it?

I've written a lot, some in Chinese, some in English, scattered in random corners over the Internet. To list several sources:

- Weixin (WeChat) official account: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/profile_ext?action=home&__biz=MzAwMzI0ODk0NA==&scene=124#wechat_redirect
  - This is like **the** blog platform in China, since WeChat is **the** texting software. I doubt if there's any blogger not writing in WeChat.
- Zhihu: https://www.zhihu.com/people/joshcena
  - The Chinese-equivalent of Quora. I post purely-academic articles here because users tend to be more educated and have patience and incentive to read these boring notes.

As you see, the list now is primarily composed of Chinese forums. I hardly know any Western platform that welcomes writers to write long articles—it seems the tradition is to have a personal page, i.e., a blog site.

So here it is—my own personal site. In the `Docs` section, the articles are designed to be *reusable*: they simply convey information; while the articles in the `Blog` are more *one-time use*: they record my experiences. If you want to see how I learned to use tools like TypeScript or Apache, look into the Blogs; if you want to learn something (math, economics, biology, anything), you'd better look at the Docs.

I do need to warn non-Chinese readers, though, that because I'm lazy, most of the articles in the Docs are migrated from Chinese platforms and thus are Chinese. You may use a translating software, but I do not guarantee the quality or correctness of results. Anyways, I hope you'll learn something, or know more about what I've done.
